Hello Bwana Samuel,
As we had talked, we want the option of our alumni registering online be available on our alumni website as it used to be.
These are the details needed from the alumni as part of online registration:

    Full Names (start with Sir name)
    Employer
    Postal address
    Phone number (s)
    Course
    Year of graduation
    Email Address

The information of the online registered alumni should be visible to the admin of the site is he/she logs in

Thank you

Andenga Henry Vincent
